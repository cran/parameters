#' @details \subsection{Small Sample Cluster corrected Degrees of Freedom}{
#' Inferential statistics (like p-values, confidence intervals and
#' standard errors) may be biased in mixed models when the number of clusters
#' is small (even if the sample size of level-1 units is high). In such cases
#' it is recommended to approximate a more accurate number of degrees of freedom
#' for such inferential statistics (see \cite{Li and Redden 2015}). The
#' \emph{Between-within} denominator degrees of freedom approximation is
#' recommended in particular for (generalized) linear mixed models with repeated
#' measurements (longitudinal design). \code{dof_betwithin}) implements a heuristic
#' based on the between-within approach. \strong{Note} that this implementation
#' does not return exactly the same results as shown in \cite{Li and Redden 2015},
#' but similar.
#' }
#' \subsection{Degrees of Freedom for Longitudinal Designs (Repeated Measures)}{
#' In particular for repeated measure designs (longitudinal data analysis),
#' the \emph{between-within} heuristic is likely to be more accurate than simply
#' using the residual or infinite degrees of freedom, because \code{dof_betwithin()}
#' returns different degrees of freedom for within-cluster and between-cluster effects.
#' }
#' @seealso \code{dof_betwithin()} and \code{se_betwithin()} are small helper-functions
#' to calculate approximated degrees of freedom and standard errors of model
#' parameters, based on the "between-within" heuristic.
