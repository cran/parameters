#' Compute group-meaned and de-meaned variables
#'
#' \code{demean()} computes group- and de-meaned versions of a
#'    variable that can be used in regression analysis to model the between-
#'    and within-subject effect.
#'
#' @param x A data frame.
#' @param select Character vector with names of variables to select that should be group- and de-meaned.
#' @param group Name of the variable that indicates the group- or cluster-ID.
#' @param suffix_demean,suffix_groupmean String value, will be appended to the names of the
#'   group-meaned and de-meaned variables of \code{x}. By default, de-meaned
#'   variables will be suffixed with \code{"_within"} and grouped-meaned variables
#'   with \code{"_between"}.
#'
#' @return A data frame with the group-/de-meaned variables, which get the suffix
#'   \code{"_between"} (for the group-meaned variable) and \code{"_within"} (for
#'   the de-meaned variable) by default.

#' @details
#'   \subsection{Panel data and correlating fixed and group effects}{
#'     \code{demean()} is intended to create group- and de-meaned variables
#'     for panel regression models (fixed effects models), or for complex
#'     random-effect-within-between models (see \cite{Bell et al. 2018}),
#'     where group-effects (random effects) and fixed effects correlate (see
#'     \cite{Bafumi and Gelman 2006)}). This violation of one of the
#'     \emph{Gauss-Markov-assumptions} can happen, for instance, when analysing panel
#'     data. To control for correlating predictors and group effects, it is
#'     recommended to include the group-meaned and de-meaned version of
#'     \emph{time-varying covariates} in the model. By this, one can fit
#'     complex multilevel models for panel data, including time-varying predictors,
#'     time-invariant predictors and random effects. This approach is superior to
#'     classic fixed-effects models, which lack information of variation in the
#'     group-effects or between-subject effects.
#'   }
#'   \subsection{Terminology}{
#'     The group-meaned variable is simply the mean of an independent variable
#'     within each group (or id-level or cluster) represented by \code{group}.
#'     It represents the cluster-mean of an independent variable. The de-meaned
#'     variable is then the centered version of the group-meaned variable. De-meaning
#'     is sometimes also called person-mean centering or centering within clusters.
#'   }
#'   \subsection{De-meaning with continuous predictors}{
#'     For continuous time-varying predictors, the recommendation is to include
#'     both their de-meaned and group-meaned versions as fixed effects, but not
#'     the raw (untransformed) time-varying predictors themselves. The de-meaned
#'     predictor should also be included as random effect (random slope). In
#'     regression models, the coefficient of the de-meaned predictors indicates
#'     the within-subject effect, while the coefficient of the group-meaned
#'     predictor indicates the between-subject effect.
#'   }
#'   \subsection{De-meaning with binary predictors}{
#'     For binary time-varying predictors, the recommendation is to include
#'     the raw (untransformed) binary predictor as fixed effect only and the
#'     \emph{de-meaned} variable as random effect (random slope)
#'     (\cite{Hoffmann 2015, chapter 8-2.I}). \code{demean()} will thus coerce
#'     categorical time-varying predictors to numeric to compute the de- and
#'     group-meaned versions for these variables.
#'   }
#'   \subsection{De-meaning interaction terms}{
#'     There are multiple ways to deal with interaction terms of within- and
#'     between-effects. A classical approach is to simply use the product
#'     term of the de-meaned variables (i.e. introducing the de-meaned variables
#'     as interaction term in the model formula, e.g. \code{y ~ x_within * time_within}).
#'     This approach, however, might be subject to bias (see \cite{Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran 2018}).
#'     \cr \cr
#'     Another option is to first calculate the product term and then apply the
#'     de-meaning to it. This approach produces an estimator \dQuote{that reflects
#'     unit-level differences of interacted variables whose moderators vary
#'     within units}, which is desirable if \emph{no} within interaction of
#'     two time-dependent variables is required. \cr \cr
#'     A third option, when the interaction should result in a genuine within
#'     estimator, is to "double de-mean" the interaction terms
#'     (\cite{Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran 2018}), however, this is currently
#'     not supported by \code{demean()}. If this is required, the \code{wmb()}
#'     function from the \pkg{panelr} package should be used. \cr \cr
#'     To de-mean interaction terms for within-between models, simply specify
#'     the term as interaction for the \code{select}-argument, e.g.
#'     \code{select = "a*b"} (see 'Examples').
#'   }

#'     A description of how to translate the
#'     formulas described in \emph{Bell et al. 2018} into R using \code{lmer()}
