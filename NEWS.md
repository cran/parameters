- The `print()`-method for `model_parameters()` gets a `select`-argument, to print only selected columns of the parameters table.
- `model_parameters()` for meta-analysis models has an improved `print()`-method for subgroups (see examples in `?model_parameters.rma`).

# parameters 0.4.0

## Breaking changes

- The column for degrees of freedom in `model_parameters()` was renamed from `df_residuals` to `df_error` for regression model objects, because these degrees of freedom actually were not always referring to _residuals_ - we consider `df_error` as a more generic name.
- `model_parameters()` for standardized parameters (i.e. `standardize` is not `NULL`) only returns standardized coefficients, CI and standard errors (and not both, unstandardized and standardized values).
- `format_ci()` was removed and re-implemented in the **insight** package.

## Renaming

- `model_bootstrap()` was renamed to `bootstrap_model()`. `model_bootstrap()` will remain as alias.
