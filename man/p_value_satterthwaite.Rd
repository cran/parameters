\description{
An approximate F-test based on the Satterthwaite (1946) approach.
}
\details{
Inferential statistics (like p-values, confidence intervals and
standard errors) may be biased in mixed models when the number of clusters
is small (even if the sample size of level-1 units is high). In such cases
it is recommended to approximate a more accurate number of degrees of freedom
for such inferential statitics. Unlike simpler approximation heuristics
like the "m-l-1" rule (\code{dof_ml1}), the Satterthwaite approximation is
also applicable in more complex multilevel designs. However, the "m-l-1"
heuristic also applies to generalized mixed models, while approaches like
Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite are limited to linear mixed models only.

\code{dof_satterthwaite()} and \code{se_satterthwaite()} are small helper-functions
to calculate approximated degrees of freedom and standard errors for model
parameters, based on the Satterthwaite (1946) approach.

\code{\link{dof_kenward}} and \code{\link{dof_ml1}} approximate degrees
of freedom bases on Kenward-Roger's method or the "m-l-1" rule.
