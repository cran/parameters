\title{Quantify the smoothness of a vector}
\usage{
smoothness(x, method = "cor", lag = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector (similar to a time series).}

\item{method}{Can be "diff" (the standard deviation of the standardized differences) or "cor" (default, lag-one autocorrelation).}

\item{lag}{An integer indicating which lag to use. If less than 1, will be interpreted as expressed in percentage of the length of the vector.}
}
\value{
Value of smoothness.
}
\description{
Quantify the smoothness of a vector
}
\examples{
x <- (-10:10)^3 + rnorm(21, 0, 100)
plot(x)
smoothness(x, method = "cor")
smoothness(x, method = "diff")
