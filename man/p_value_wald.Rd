\title{Wald-test approximation for CIs and p-values}
\usage{
ci_wald(model, ci = 0.95, dof = Inf)

p_value_wald(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A statistical model.}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level. Default to 0.95 (95\%).}

\item{dof}{Degrees of Freedom.}
}
\value{
The p-values.
}
\description{
The Wald-test approximation treats t-values as Wald z. Since the t distribution converges to the z distribution as degrees of freedom increase, this is like assuming infinite degrees of freedom. While this is unambiguously anti-conservative, this approximation appears as reasonable for reasonable sample sizes (Barr et al., 2013). That is, if we take the p-value to measure the probability of a false positive, this approximation produces a higher false positive rate than the nominal 5\% at p = 0.05.
