\usage{
standardize(x, ...)

\method{standardize}{numeric}(x, robust = FALSE, method = "default",
  verbose = TRUE, ...)

\method{standardize}{factor}(x, force = FALSE, ...)

\method{standardize}{data.frame}(x, robust = FALSE, method = "default",
  select = NULL, exclude = NULL, verbose = TRUE, force = FALSE,
  ...)

\method{standardize}{lm}(x, robust = FALSE, method = "default",
  include_response = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A dataframe, a vector or a statistical model.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{robust}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, centering is done by substracting the
median from the variables and divide it by the median absolute deviation
(MAD). If \code{FALSE}, variables are standardized by substracting the
mean and divide it by the standard deviation (SD).}

\item{method}{The method of standardization. For data.frames, can be \code{"default"} (variables are centred by mean or median, and divided by SD or MAD, depending on \code{robust}) or \code{"2sd"}, in which case they are divided by two times the deviation (SD or MAD, again depending on \code{robust}).}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings on or off.}

\item{force}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, forces standardization of factors as
well. Factors are converted to numerical values, with the lowest level
being the value \code{1} (unless the factor has numeric levels, which are
converted to the corresponding numeric value).}

\item{select}{For a data frame, character vector of column names to be
standardized. If \code{NULL} (the default), all variables will be
standardized.}

\item{exclude}{For a data frame, character vector of column names to
be excluded from standardization.}

\item{include_response}{For a model, if \code{TRUE} (default), the response value
will also be standardized. If \code{FALSE}, only the predictors will be standardized.
Note that for certain models (logistic regression, count models, ...), the
response value will never be standardized, to make re-fitting the model work.}
}
\value{
The standardized object (either a standardize dataframe or a statistical model fitted on standardized data).
}
\description{
Performs a standardization of data (Z-scoring), i.e., centred and scaled, so that the data is expressed in terms of standard deviation (i.e., mean = 0, SD = 1) or Median Absolute Deviance (median = 0, MAD = 1). When applied to a statistical model, this function extracts the dataset, standardizes it, and refits the model with this standardized version of the dataset. The \code{\link{normalize}} function can also be used to scale all numeric variables within the 0 - 1 range.
