\title{Format PCA/FA from the psych package}
\usage{
\method{model_parameters}{principal}(model, sort = FALSE,
  threshold = NULL, labels = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{PCA or FA created by the \code{psych::principal} or \code{psych::fa} functions.}

\item{sort}{Sort the loadings.}

\item{threshold}{A value between 0 and 1 indicates which (absolute) values from the loadings should be removed. Can also be "max", in which case it will only display the maximum loading per veriable (the most simple structure).}

\item{labels}{A character vector containing labels to be added to the loadings data. Usually, the question related to the item.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of loadings.

\description{
Format PCA/FA objects from the psych package (Revelle, 2016).

\details{
\itemize{
   \item \strong{Complexity} (Hoffman's, 1978; Pettersson and Turkheimer, 2010) represents the number of latent components needed to account for the observed variables. Whereas a perfect simple structure solution has a complexity of 1 in that each item would only load on one factor, a solution with evenly distributed items has a complexity greater than 1.
   \item \strong{Uniqueness} represents the variance that is 'unique' to the variable and not shared with other variables. It is equal to \code{1 â€“ communality} (variance that is shared with other variables). A uniqueness of \code{0.20} suggests that 20\% or that variable's variance is not shared with other variables in the overall factor model. The greater 'uniqueness' the lower the relevance of the variable in the factor model.
