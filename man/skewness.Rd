\details{
\subsection{Skewness}{
Symmetric distributions have a \code{skewness} around zero, while
a negative skewness values indicates a "left-skewed" distribution, and a
positive skewness values indicates a "right-skewed" distribution. Examples
for the relationship of skewness and distributions are:
\itemize{
  \item Normal distribution (and other symmetric distribution) has a skewness of 0
  \item Half-normal distribution has a skewness just below 1
  \item Exponential distribution has a skewness of 2
  \item Lognormal distribution can have a skewness of any positive value, depending on its parameters
}
(\cite{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness})
}
\subsection{Types of Skewness}{
\code{skewness()} supports three different methods for estimating skewness, as discussed in \cite{Joanes and Gill (1988)}:
\itemize{
\item Type "1" is the "classical" method, which is \code{g1 = (sum((x - mean(x))^3) / n) / (sum((x - mean(x))^2) / n)^1.5}
\item Type "2" first calculates the type-1 skewness, than adjusts the result: \code{G1 = g1 * sqrt(n * (n - 1)) / (n - 2)}. This is what SAS and SPSS usually return
\item Type "3" first calculates the type-1 skewness, than adjusts the result: \code{b1 = g1 * ((1 - 1 / n))^1.5}. This is what Minitab usually returns.
}
}
\subsection{Kurtosis}{
The \code{kurtosis} is a measure of "tailedness" of a distribution. A distribution
with a kurtosis values of about zero is called "mesokurtic". A kurtosis value
larger than zero indicates a "leptokurtic" distribution with \emph{fatter} tails.
A kurtosis value below zero indicates a "platykurtic" distribution with \emph{thinner}
tails (\cite{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis}).

\subsection{Types of Kurtosis}{
\code{kurtosis()} supports three different methods for estimating kurtosis, as discussed in \cite{Joanes and Gill (1988)}:
\itemize{
\item Type "1" is the "classical" method, which is \code{g2 = n * sum((x - mean(x))^4) / (sum((x - mean(x))^2)^2) - 3}.
\item Type "2" first calculates the type-1 kurtosis, than adjusts the result: \code{G2 = ((n + 1) * g2 + 6) * (n - 1)/((n - 2) * (n - 3))}. This is what SAS and SPSS usually return
\item Type "3" first calculates the type-1 kurtosis, than adjusts the result: \code{b2 = (g2 + 3) * (1 - 1 / n)^2 - 3}. This is what Minitab usually returns.
